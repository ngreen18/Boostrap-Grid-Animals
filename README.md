Bootstrap Grid!

Today we're going to practice organizing our pages with rows and columns!

Step 1: Code Along

- Put all of the bootstrap cards in a container
- Put all of the bootstrap cards in a row
- Put each bootstrap card in its own column



Step 2: Play Time!

- Create three more cards (by copying and pasting) and use the cat - photos in the asset folder
- Try to get all six photos in one row
- Try to get the three dog photos in the top row and the three cat photos in the bottom row



Challenge! (If you have time...)

- Create "more interesting" grid layouts of your choosing!
- Play around with the styling on the css file to try and change things like the text color or to center the text!
